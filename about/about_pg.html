      <h3>Site Description</h3>
      <p>
        This is a web application that allows users to gather informational reports about humantirian relief efforts and disasters worldwide. Users will be able to look at published reports by reputable established sources, from the United Nations Office for the Corrdination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), based on diffferent parameters, such as : disaster types, geolocation by country or events expanding worldwide reach, publishing organization, report language, and keyword search. The WeMundo application takes it a step further, by allowing users to see all reports related to their search results in the context of an interactive Google map, and lists of reports. The application has desktop, mobile, and tablet responsive capabilities.

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          As developers, who were previously in the biology and science fields, we wanted to create an application that could be useful for people who are looking for information reharding humanitarian issues around the world. The WeMundo application is an easy to use tool for individuals looking for readily accessible and reliable maps and information.
          Thank you to UN OCHA ReliefWeb for the development of reports and maps data API. We sought out inspiration from their current search website: <a href = "https://reliefweb.int/">https://reliefweb.int/</a>.
